**Prompts as Code: A New Programming Paradigm**

Welcome to aicode, a curated collection of prompt templates for Claude Code that treats prompts as a first-class programming language. Just as we version control our traditional code, prompts deserve the same level of care, documentation, and collaborative development.

## Philosophy

In the age of AI-assisted development, prompts have evolved beyond simple requests into sophisticated instructions that can:
- Define complex workflows and logic
- Specify architectural patterns and constraints
- Orchestrate multi-step development processes
- Encode domain knowledge and best practices

We believe prompts are **code** ‚Äì they're executable instructions that produce deterministic outputs, can be optimized for performance, debugged when they fail, and shared across teams.

## What's Inside

This repository contains battle-tested prompt templates for Claude Code, organized by:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
- System architecture planning
- Database schema design
- API design patterns
- Microservices decomposition

### üîß Development Workflows
- Code review and refactoring
- Testing strategy implementation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Documentation generation

### üêõ Debugging & Optimization
- Error analysis and resolution
- Performance optimization
- Code quality improvements
- Security vulnerability assessment

### üìö Learning & Exploration
- Technology evaluation
- Best practice research
- Code explanation and teaching
- Proof-of-concept development

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aicode.git
   cd aicode
   ```

2. **Browse templates by category**
   ```
   templates/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debugging/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ learning/
   ```

3. **Use with Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude-code --prompt-file templates/development/code-review.md
   ```

## Template Structure

Each prompt template follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Template Name

**Purpose**: Brief description of what this prompt accomplishes
**Best Used For**: Specific scenarios where this prompt excels
**Prerequisites**: What you need before using this prompt

## The Prompt

[The actual prompt template with variables marked as {{variable}}]

## Usage Example

[Concrete example of how to use the prompt]

## Expected Output

[Description of what Claude Code will produce]

## Variations

[Alternative versions or modifications of the base prompt]
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Prompts evolve through community collaboration, just like traditional code.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a new branch** for your prompt template
3. **Follow the template structure** outlined above
4. **Test your prompt** with Claude Code
5. **Document edge cases** and limitations
6. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of the prompt's purpose
   - Examples of successful outputs
   - Any known limitations or considerations

### Contribution Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Prompts should be clear and unambiguous
- **Modularity**: Break complex prompts into reusable components
- **Documentation**: Include usage examples and expected outcomes
- **Testing**: Verify prompts work as expected before submitting
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for significant prompt changes

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
- Be specific about desired outputs and formats
- Provide context and constraints upfront
- Use examples to clarify expectations
- Structure complex requests with numbered steps
- Include error handling and edge case guidance

### Organizing Your Prompt Library
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Tag prompts with relevant keywords
- Maintain a prompt changelog
- Version control prompt iterations
- Document performance characteristics

### Collaboration
- Share successful prompt patterns
- Provide feedback on others' templates
- Report bugs and suggest improvements
- Contribute to documentation
